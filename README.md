# As Above, So Below
A minecraft alchemy mod, thematically and mechanically inspired by Equivalent Exchange, Thaumcraft and Fullmetal Alchemist.

This is super early WIP, but the plan is to provide a transmutation framework for turning blocks into other blocks, in a way that doesn't toatally destroy any suggestion of balance the game has.
